# Books-Price-Monitoring-and-Sentiment-Analysis
This project introduces an intelligent Python-based system that automates the extraction, 
monitoring, and analysis of book prices and customer sentiments from an online bookstore. By 
integrating web scraping, sentiment classification, data visualization, and an interactive menu
driven interface, the solution provides real-time insights into book pricing and reader 
satisfaction. The tool simplifies decision-making for readers and book enthusiasts by offering 
a centralized way for sentiment-rich book exploration.
